# Features

The `strict-path` crate provides several optional features that extend functionality while maintaining the core security guarantees. All features are disabled by default to keep the core library lightweight.

## Available Features

### `dirs` - OS Standard Directories
Cross-platform access to operating system standard directories following platform conventions (XDG Base Directory on Linux, Known Folder API on Windows, Apple Standard Directories on macOS).

```toml
[dependencies]
strict-path = { version = "0.1.0-alpha.1", features = ["dirs"] }
```

Enables constructors like:
- `PathBoundary::try_new_os_config("MyApp")` - Application configuration
- `PathBoundary::try_new_os_data("MyApp")` - Application data storage  
- `PathBoundary::try_new_os_cache("MyApp")` - Application cache
- `PathBoundary::try_new_os_documents()` - User documents directory
- And many more...

### `serde` - Serialization Support
Adds `Serialize` implementations for `StrictPath` and `VirtualPath`, plus deserialization helpers for secure path handling in web APIs and configuration files.

```toml
[dependencies]
strict-path = { version = "0.1.0-alpha.1", features = ["serde"] }
```

Enables:
- Direct serialization: `serde_json::to_string(&strict_path)?`
- Context-aware deserialization helpers
- Integration with web frameworks and config parsers

### `tempfile` - Temporary Directories
RAII temporary directories that are automatically cleaned up when dropped, with each `PathBoundary` getting a unique temporary directory.

```toml
[dependencies]  
strict-path = { version = "0.1.0-alpha.1", features = ["tempfile"] }
```

Enables:
- `PathBoundary::try_new_temp()` - Unique temporary directory
- `PathBoundary::try_new_temp_with_prefix("my-prefix")` - Custom prefix
- Automatic cleanup when the boundary is dropped

### `app-path` - Portable Application Directories
Integration with the `app-path` crate for discovering application directories relative to the executable with environment variable overrides.

```toml
[dependencies]
strict-path = { version = "0.1.0-alpha.1", features = ["app-path"] }
```

Enables portable application directory discovery for:
- Configuration directories relative to executable
- Data directories with environment overrides
- Cross-platform deployment scenarios

## Feature Combinations

Features can be combined as needed:

```toml
[dependencies]
strict-path = { 
    version = "0.1.0-alpha.1", 
    features = ["dirs", "serde", "tempfile"] 
}
```

## Design Philosophy

All optional features:
- **Maintain security**: Never compromise path boundary enforcement
- **Zero-cost when unused**: Features add no overhead if not enabled  
- **Composable**: Features work together seamlessly
- **Platform-aware**: Handle platform differences gracefully
- **Standards-compliant**: Follow established conventions and specifications

## Migration and Compatibility

Features are additive and backward-compatible. Enabling new features won't break existing code, and the core API remains stable across all feature combinations.

When features are unavailable:
- Missing feature methods result in compile-time errors (not runtime failures)
- Documentation clearly indicates feature requirements
- Examples include feature guards for conditional compilation
